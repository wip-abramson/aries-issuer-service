# Aries ACA-Py Issuer Service

A basic aries agent configuration that creates a multi-use invitation and issues a specific type of credential to any agent that connects to it. Easily configurable and extendable. 

Uses the [Aries Cloud Agent](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) and [Aries Basic Controller](https://pypi.org/project/aries-basic-controller/).

Works along the lines of the [aries-full-stack-starter](https://github.com/wip-abramson/aries-acapy-fullstack-starter) project, just without a frontend interface.
